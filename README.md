This program is for fun.
using WIN32 and C++ and thread, 
click per scond is shown in window by number and graph.
Visual Studio Code and CMake build system is used.
CMake generates Visual Studio solution, so you can build using Visual Studio as well.

The software is unstable sometimes.
2 problems.
1) The windows is closed suddenly
2) The number changed to small font.
